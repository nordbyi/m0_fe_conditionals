# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Reasonably confident. I'm so fortunate to have already put in some time on this topic.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Pretty good.  They always seem to trip me up when I get a little casual with them.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Actually not terribly confident in them, mostly because I haven't used them in a while, but I'm pretty sure they'll come back pretty fast.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Spent about 1.5 hours broken up across the day.  The lesson and work had more components than I had anticipated, but my previous knowledge of the subjects help immensely.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Just getting the specific syntax down again. Need more practice. But I can use other upcoming work to do that I think.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None at the moment.
